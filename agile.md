# agile

## Good practice that nice to apply 
* [HBDI model](https://www.thinkherrmann.com/the-whole-brain-thinking-methodology) how people see themself

# Scrum
* [SAFe](http://scaleagileframework.com/)
* [LeSS](https://less.works/)
  * [LeSS book](https://less.works/user-content/member/Learning-Resources/less_book.html)

# agile alternatives
* LEAN ( ToyotaProductionSystem )
  > It aimed to reduce inventory costs and improve the efficiency of the automobile supply chain by eliminating any type of waste.   
  > for standard/repeat work, not for complex tasks

# my own improvements of Scrum/LeSS/XP

## Context
Whole team after planning2 and splitting up all UserStories into tasks don't have clear vision what should be done for some of them and how to start work on it ( or even more ) of them ( US )

## Decision
Using technique "Measurement of understability" to detect not clear stories and work on it ( them ) again and again

* at the end of planning2 phase each team member should write down papers with numbers of US from backlog on them
* put them on measurement board with his/him own understanding of implementation of it
* evaluate mostly critical story and re-plan it again

## Consequences
* decrease likelihood of defects ( increase quality )
* decrease delays ( task switching, information exchange )
