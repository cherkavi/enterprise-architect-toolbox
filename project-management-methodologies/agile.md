## 4C in scrum
* Collaborate:
  > Agile teams collaborate in order to realize their common objectives, 
  > putting their individual talents and skills to good use in the process.
  * Shared Ownership: 
    > Sharing tasks. Every member of the team brings their own set of skills and points of view to the table.
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration
    > Break down silos and encourage cooperation across departments and functions.   
    > All roles works closely together to provide valuable increments of the product.  
  * Empathy and Respect: 
    > Agile teams engage in active listening, value a variety of viewpoints, 
    > and construct relationships founded on trust and mutual respect for one another.
* Communicate:
  > Collaboration is fueled by open and effective communication, which ensures that there is a common understanding and alignment.
  * Open and Transparent Discussions
    > Dialogues that are open and honest - information is not restricted in any way. 
    > Regular communication ( updates, new discoveries, upcoming obstacles, and ideas ) 
  * Active Listening
  * Visual Communication
    > Using graphical tools like as Kanban boards, burn-down charts, and user narrative maps to enhance communication (clear and succinct ).
* Create:
  > Agile teams let their creative geniuses shine, transforming concepts into outputs that are both concrete and valuable.
  * Iterative Development
    > iterative approach with measurable improvements - constant feedback and learning ( enhancement of existing features )
  * Empirical Decision-Making
    > Using facts, observations, and feedback from the actual world 
  * Innovation and Adaptability
    > Encourage members of the team to explore new ideas and experiment with alternative methods  
    > which contributes to the culture of innovation that they cultivate. 
* Confirm:
  > Check if the job is up to the standards that have been established.
  > Agile teams make certain that the product satisfies the requirements and requirements of stakeholders through the processes of validation and quality assurance.
  * Continuous Testing
    > Test at every stage of the development process (quality requirements).
    > detect problems early on and resolve them proactively.
  * Acceptance Criteria
    > Defining unambiguous acceptance criteria for user stories. 
  * Stakeholder Involvement
    > Stakeholders are actively involved in the confirmation process (feedback) - confirm that the final result meets their expectations.  

# my own improvements of Scrum/LeSS/XP

## Context
Whole team after planning2 and splitting up all UserStories into tasks don't have clear vision what should be done for some of them and how to start work on it ( or even more ) of them ( US )

## Decision
Using technique "Measurement of understability" to detect not clear stories and work on it ( them ) again and again
![Measurement of understability](https://i.postimg.cc/GhQsYYVW/sketch1563428744901.png)
* at the end of planning2 phase each team member should write down papers with numbers of US from backlog on them
* put them on measurement board with his/him own understanding of implementation of it
* evaluate mostly critical story and re-plan it again

## Consequences
* decrease likelihood of defects ( increase quality )
* decrease delays ( task switching, information exchange )
