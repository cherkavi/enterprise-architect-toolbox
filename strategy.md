# Strategy
> based on my own experience and understanding the book: "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy"

## Signs of bad strategies
* without victims ( without sucrificing anything, anyone/anything is happy )
* use the same template "as from previous time" ( golden hummer antipattern )
* you are considering only positive aspects ( only "positive mindset" )
