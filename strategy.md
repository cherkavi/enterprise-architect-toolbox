# Strategy
> based on my own experience and understanding the book: "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy"

---
## Core of the Strategy 

### 1. The Diagnosis
This is an explanation of the nature of the challenge. 
* **Goal:** To define "what is going on here.". Understand your focus
* **Key Action:** Look for the hidden patterns or the specific obstacle that is preventing progress.
* **Example:** "Our sales are dropping not because of the product, but because our distribution network is outdated."

### 2. The Guiding Policy
It provides the "direction" without getting bogged down in every tiny detail yet.
* **Goal:** To create a signpost that directs energy in a specific way. Create a Plan
* **Key Action:** Focus on leverage. A guiding policy should channel resources toward a specific advantage.
* **Example:** "We will shift our entire focus to direct-to-consumer digital sales to bypass traditional retail bottlenecks."

### 3. Coherent Actions
Re-arrange the existing resources ( someone will suffer )
* **Goal:** To translate the policy into "walking orders."
* **Key Action:** Ensure that Step A makes Step B easier or more effective.
* **Example:** Investing in a new web platform, hiring a social media marketing team, and closing physical warehouses simultaneously.

## Signs of bad strategies
* without victims ( without sucrificing anything, anyone/anything is happy )
* use the same template "as from previous time" ( golden hummer antipattern )
* you are considering only positive aspects ( only "positive mindset" )
