# conflict resolution
> how to manage existing outcomes after conflicts
> checklist for before/after conflict events


## conflict situation description
> need to have chronology of events ( with proofs if possible )
1. write down all events and mark conflict-events
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR

   
   e1((1)) --> e2((2)) --> e3((3)) --> e4((k4)) --> e5((5)) --> e6((k6))

   style e4 fill:red,stroke:red
   style e6 fill:red,stroke:red
   ```
2. with whom ( list all of them ) you have conflict
3. mark on the timeline ( extend if not exists ) pre-conflict events or conflict-initiator events
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR

   
   e1((1)) --> e2((2)) --> e3((3)) --> e4((k4)) --> e5((5)) --> e6((k6))

   style e4 fill:red,stroke:red
   style e6 fill:red,stroke:red

   style e2 fill:darkorange,stroke:red
   style e5 fill:darkorange,stroke:red
   ```
4. who (list all of them) CAN potentially/theoretically make influence on conflict-initiator events ?
5. who (shrink previous list) has done commitment in conflict-initiator events ?
6. what happend during conflict events ( with involved persons )

## conflict analysing
> for each of the listed below points provide also list of people from previous steps
1. why do you think that you have experienced conflict (red events) ?
2. what was negative/emotional in each situation for you ?
3. what the consiquences are you expecting to see in future ?

## conflict next step
1. try to image situation/state when you will be satisfied with any "compensation" from "aggressor side"
2. is it possible to achieve this "compensation" ?
   1. yes - move on
   2. no - return to step 1
3. do you have energy/resources to achieve "compensation" actions from "aggressor" or involve someone on your side ?
