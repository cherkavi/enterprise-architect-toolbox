## Principles

### meta education
Education is :
* time usage management
* motivation management
* problem solving strategy

Questionary:
#### Why ?
  * your goal
  * your driver
  * your result at the end
#### What ?
  * what the knowledge ?
  * what the capability (+knowledge) ?
  * fill the table:  
    |  conceptions | facts    | procedures |
    |--------------|----------|------------|
    |  understand  | remember |  practice  |  
    |     ...      |   ...    |    ...     |
  * emphasize most important   
    20% of the mandatory volume
#### How ?
  > resources, environment, methods/approaches
  * References/classic-roadmap:
    * University programm
    * Official book
    * Tutor/Professional
    * Online Course
  * Re-Arranging ( emphasize/neglect )
    > you have something similar or base knowledge  
    > you should spend 5%..10% of the overall time
    * collect diff programs and tutorials ( inputs )
    * try diff ways  of learing and select best single/parallel like: video, articles, online courses, tutors .... 
    * create your roadmap based on emphasizing and neglecting the points from all the inputs
    * after first steps ( milestones ) evaluate your progress, make re-evaluation of input sources
  * [copy existing solution/idea](#exercises), but add your unique style 
  * develop your unique style - it is your advantage

### focusing
> breathing 4x4   
> breathing 30-30, 30-60, 30-90
* you should devote/prepare:
  * time in your calendar
  * place for working on
  * all tools
* use what you learn in practice: pet-project or real task
* procrastination ( how to overcome )
  * why do you procrastinating ?
    * any emotions ?
    * any pain points ?
  * start with first 5/10 min of the time ( apply pomodoro after )
  * patience, diligence
  * in order not to give up - set up timer for 10 min, try again 
* distractions
  * external: wrong place, people, smart devices ?
  * internal: tire, emotions, wishes, wrong type of materials
  * make notes
    * what you have seen  
    * what you have seen and what are your thoughts
    * questions to yourself as reminder
  * switching activities 
  * find your level of concentration/excitement

### fixing/consolidation
> when something is not pan out - it's good
* try to solve without books and clues
* [write down some thoughts after the reading](#focusing)
* [write questions to yourself](#focusing)
* create mind map
* find out ( or even generate ) problem for solving with currently learned knoweledge - apply
* for [facts/remember](#what-) - repeat in intevals ( like Anki )
* overlearning 
  * take a look more deeper and wider
  * longer, after understanding
* mnemonic association with real-life parallel 
  * like pillars for http packages ... 
  * like water pump for electricity

### exercises
* break up to the steps:
  * implementation (practice)
  * cognitive areas of knowledge (understanding)
* find out difficult and cumbersome steps - practice them separately
* have you stuck ?:
  1. step back
  2. learn
  3. try again

### feedback
> is necessary for understanding your real level ( Quo vadis ?)  
> is result of your action
> should be collected from professional! more than one!
* feedback/criticism:
  * constructive ( useful )
  * emotional    ( non-useful )
* informative feedback
  * what was wrong/incorrect
* corrective feedback 
  * what was wrong/incorrect
  * what to improve/fix

### [Feynman method](https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique)
> when no understanding, no solution  
* write down widly the subject/problem
* explain it to 12-years old ( virtually )
* for non-comfortable areas - return to source of info
* simplify explanation and create alternative ways
