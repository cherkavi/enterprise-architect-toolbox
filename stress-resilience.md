# Stress resilience
for your internal peace you must rely on yourself 
( not on someone )
Input stress  ---> Transformation ---> Self confident (goal oriented)

## Perception of events
**you should see only positive sides**
|  what you feel      |  transformed to |
|---------------------|-----------------|
|     ~~stress~~      |   challenge,    |
| ~~rage/fury/anger~~ |   opportunity for growth  |
|   ~~sadness~~       |                 |

## Discomfort
small difficulties and obstacles should be a norm of your day-life
* the preparation of yourself for a big jump
* self control
* when you have difficulties - you are growing
