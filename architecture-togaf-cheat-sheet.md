# Archimate
![when to use archimate](https://archimate-community.pages.opengroup.org/workgroups/archimate-101/part_1/images/why_6.png)
> * Research  -     create notes   
> * Coherence - use/update notes ( a bit create new ) 
> * Details   -        use notes ( a bit update )  
> *after "Details" you can start from the beginning but on another level*

# Archimate extensions 

## archi tool
## Archimate to SVG export improvement. Update destination SVG with all links from documentation properties ( also add popup hints to elements).

# Start drawing
## [Perspectives](http://weblog.tetradian.com/2012/06/06/inside-in-inside-out-outside-in-outside-out/)
* **inside-in**
  > develop a broad understanding of what clean-up would be required    
  > _within each domain in scope_   
* **outside-out**
  > develop a broad understanding of the  
  > _overall business-ecosystem_, in its own terms,   
  > independent of our own organisation  
* **outside-in**
  > develop a broad to detailed understanding of  
  > _how others would interact and transact with our organisation_, from their perspective  
* **inside-out**
  > (usually together with a detailed _inside-in_): develop a detailed architecture     
  > for each domain, each from its own perspective,    
  > drawing on each of _outside-in_ perspectives for guidance    

## Purpose/Viewpoints
inside-in
* **Informing** achieve understanding or obtain commitment.
  > The main goal is to elicit feedback to make sure that the communication is effective.
* **Deciding** support the process of decision-making and often target managers
  > The main goal is to obtain a decision or a choice between several options.
* **Designing** support the design process from initial sketch to detailed design
  > The main goal is usually to define or refine a target.

## Content
* **Overview** - helicopter view on a subject which usually mixes multiples domains 
  > targets decision-makers or enterprise architects.
* **Coherence/Collaboration** - focus on one specific topic, but seen through multiple complementary angles.
  > collaboration between people, processes or tools.
* **Details** - focus on one specific topic and zoom in only one of its aspects.
  > subject matter experts or software engineers.

## Drawing 
* avoid line crossing
* bigger elements will be understood as being more important
* Align elements on a grid and between each other.
* Use whitespace instead of actually using a visual group.
