# Negotiations
1. collect information about your [opponent](#opponent)
2. prepare for negotiations with [negotiation map](#negotiation-map)
3. during the negotiations [make notes](#making-notes) and write your thoughts
4. make a "retrospective" afterwards

## Opponent 
### You can speak with:
1. Organization ( no persons, just business roles )
2. Group of people ( 2+ )
3. Single person ( at the end )
   > In most cases it will be one-to-one conversation ( even with couple of people each of them will be responsible for separate area ).

### **What you want to achieve**
between you and your goal there are 1+ steps
```mermaid
flowchart LR 
y(you) --> s1((.))  --> s2((.))  --> s3((.))  --> s4((.)) --> s5((.)) --> g[(goal)]
```
**and role of your opponent can be:**  
1. beginning: opponent should play role before you are going to start you journey
```mermaid
flowchart LR 
y(you) --> s1((.))  --> s2((.))  --> s3((.))  --> s4((.)) --> s5((.)) --> g[(goal)]

o(opponent) -.-> y
o ~~~ s1
```
2. middle: opponent should play role in one/many step(s)
```mermaid
flowchart LR 
y(you) --> s1((.))  --> s2((.))  --> s3((.))  --> s4((.)) --> s5((.)) --> g[(goal)]

o(opponent) -.-> s3
o(opponent) -.-> s5
o ~~~ s1
```

3. end: opponent is controlling access to the goal
```mermaid
flowchart LR 
y(you) --> s1((.))  --> s2((.))  --> s3((.))  --> s4((.)) --> s5((.)) --> o(opponent) --> g[(goal)]
```

### Advices
#### Explanation cards
For each point create paper-card with 1-2 sentences.
Each "explanation card" should have 1-3 icons/tags to show the emotions like:
1. smile
2. past, now, future
3. work/job out-of-work
4. link
5. idea (bulb)
6. goal
7. dangerous
8. resources
9. capability

#### Opponent's concerns and risks 
prepare story(ies) about each of them
