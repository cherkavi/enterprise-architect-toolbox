## Project management methodologies
> [overview, when to use](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/project-management-methodology)  
> [guides](https://www.projectmanager.com/guides)  

- [Waterfall (SDLC) Methodology](./project-management-methodologies/waterfall.md)
  > ideal for short, uncomplicated projects.  
  > Sequential list of tasks, a task cannot be initiated until the previous one is complete, and you cannot return to a previous task.
- LEAN ( ToyotaProductionSystem )
  > It aimed to reduce inventory costs and improve the efficiency by eliminating any type of waste (remove any excess efforts).   
  > for standard/repeat work, not for complex tasks
- [Agile Methodology](./project-management-methodologies/agile.md)
  >  fast, continuous improvement. 
  - Scrum
  - Kanban
    > ideal for teams that need constant output on a project and want to maximize efficiency
  - Scrumban
- Six Sigma
  > improve quality by identifying what is not working in the project. 
- Critical Path Method (CPM)
  > gathering all the required activities needed to complete a project  
  > and sorting them by duration and dependencies. 
  > for project teams who want a straightforward sequence of tasks and estimated duration of activities  
- Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)
  > Critical Path extension with considering resources availability.  
  > for teams who need to prioritize tasks by resource renewability and the minimal time needed for completion (with a buffer added)
- PRiSM - PRojects integrating Sustainable Methods
  > goal of reducing any negative environmental, economic, and social effects caused by the project
  > primarily used for large real estate development, construction, or infrastructure projects.
- Project management institute’s PMBOK® Guide
- Extreme Project Management (XPM)
- Extreme Programming (XPM)
- Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
- Milestone Trend Analysis
- PRINCE2 - PRojects IN Controlled Environments
  > the standard methodology of the U.K. government
  > best suited for larger organizations
  > based on consistent processes, controlled stages (beginning, middle, end), properly allocated resources, regular progress reviews and alignment with business justifications.
- Hermes 
  > the standard methodology of Switzerland government
