# Architecture theorie

## What architecture is 
* path to solution 
* framework for change
* set of building blocks (composition) with interfaces that they are consuming and providing  
* not equals to design

### Building blocks
> block == building block  
> building block != component   

#### building blocks views
* black
* grey
  > show configuration and internal dependencies/blocks
* white


### Interfaces 
> interfact == access point   
 
#### types depends on communication
* import 
  > we should adjust ourself to it
* export
  > another side should consider our contract
* standart 
  > both sides should adjust themselft for communication
* independent
  > there are "adapter" between two interfaces who is taking care about the communication
